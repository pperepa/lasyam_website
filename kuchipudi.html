			<article>
				<p>Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district, which is currently in
					State of Andhra Pradesh, India. This village originally derived its name from Kuchelapuram. In this
					village, resident Brahmins practiced this traditional dance form for decades until the village
					itself
					earned the name Kuchipudi. The great talent within the village of Kuchipudi is nurtured by scholars,
					gurus, and artists who refined its technique for centuries and continue to build its repertoire.</p>

				<p>It was believed that the Saint Siddhendra Yogi, in the 14th century of Indian history, was blessed by
					Lord Nataraja (Lord of Dance) and taught the first dance drama to Kuchipudi Brahmin boys, to empower
					them. He was the author of the renowned Kuchipudi dance drama “Bhamakalapam.” Siddhendra Yogi
					trained
					actors who put on plays by teaching them, to become Bhagavatulu, performers of the Bhagavata Mela
					Natakams. Siddhendra Yogi is said to be the first scholar to give it the current form of dance
					drama.
					Bhamakalapam is one of his celebrated compositions. He reserved Kuchipudi to males only. However, in
					modern times, it has been embraced and celebrated by women.</p>

				<p>Later in 1675 A.D. Abul Hasan Kutubshah Navab of Golkonda had given Kuchipudi Agraharam to
					Bhagavatulu. After the Vijayanagara Dynasty, some of these Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu migrated to other
					villages,
					like Melattur in Tanjavur, and started teaching Kuchipudi Bhagavatham. These artists' main objective
					was
					Bhagavataradhana (Bhakthi), so they are called Bhagavatulu.</p>

				<p>The repertoire of Kuchipudi, follows the three categories of performance inferred from the ancient
					treatise on Dramaturgy, the Natya Sastra. These are Nritta (pure dance, fast and rhythmic foot
					work), Nritya (expressive dance to communicate feelings and emotions) and Natya (play production).
					Kuchipudi is accompanied by Carnatic music. A typical orchestra for a Kuchipudi recital includes the
					mridangam, flute, veena, violin, and ghatam. A vocalist sings the songs, and the Nattuvanar conducts
					the orchestra and recites the rhythmic Jathi patterns.</p>

				<p>Kuchipudi is unique among the Indian classical dance styles for its dance dramas with live dialogues
					while performing on the stage and male actors who also take female roles. The earliest and the most
					celebrated work in Kuchipudi is, the famous dance drama Bhamakalapam, another is Tarangam.</p>

				<p>Tarangam, the performer dances on the edges of a brass plate, executing complicated rhythmic foot
					patterns with dexterity, while also balancing a brass pot of water on their head. The Tarangam
					demonstrates a dancer’s masterful coordination and understanding of balance, rhythm, and speed,
					while employing incomparable abhinayam.

		<h1 class="headings">Bhamakalapam</h1>
		<section title="Bhamakalapam" id="s-kuchipudi_today">
			<p>
				Bhamakalapam illustrates a famous episode from the Bhagavatam in which the proud Princess Satyabhama
				insists that Lord Krishna, her husband, bring her the celestial Parijata plant from Lord Indra’s garden.
			</p>

			<p>It starts with the Suthradhara, who recites devotional slokas and offers harati to the Princess
				Satyabhama’s Jada (long plaited hair). This is called the Jada Bharatham. In this act, Princess
				Satyabhama throws over her curtain of hair ornamented with 27 studded stars which symbolize the
				constellation, a five hooded mythical serpent, and tiny golden images of the 10 incarnations of Lord
				Vishnu. Bhamakalapam was initially performed for three days with the Jada Bharatam act, but more
				recently, a shorter version called Pravesa Dharuvu is performed. The essence of Bhamakalapam is, the
				eternal oneness of Atma, (Satyabhama) and Paramatma (Krishna).
