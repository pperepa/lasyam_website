				<p>Artistic Director Hemamalini Yaddanapudi is the
					founder of the Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance.
					Hema started her first dance lessons when she was six years old. Her first Guru, Sri Bhagavthula
					Yagna
					Narayana Sarmagaru, hailed from the village of Kuchipudi itself. She learned her first item from
					him,
					called “Rara Venu Gopa Bala” at age 7. Hema studied under Sarmagaru’s tutelage and earned her
					diplomas
					in Kuchipudi and Bharthanatyam; which she accomplished by the time she was 15 years old. Hema also
					attended the Central University of Hyderabad for the Masters of Performing Arts program for
					Kuchipudi.
					Hema also had the privilege of learning from Sarma garu’s son Bhagavathula Venkata Rama Sarma garu;
					under his tutelage she learned popular Kuchipudi style established by Sri Vempati China Satyam garu.

				<p>Hema, throughout her childhood, heard stories about Kuchipudi from her father Y.V. Hanumatharao, a
					renowned lawyer in Vijayawada, who hailed from Yaddanapudi (a town neighboring Kuchipudi). Growing
					up near Kuchipudi, he experienced Kuchipudi performances in temples during various festivals. As a
					child, Hema heard her father share the wonderful memories about Kuchipudi dancers and their
					performances, called the Veedhi Natakam or Veedhi Bhagavatam, known as “Bhagavatha Mela Natakams”
					(Stories of God), which are traditionally performed by the traveling dance troupe which consisted
					entirely of men (often Brahmins). These traveling dance troupes moved from village to village and
					performed near local Hindu temples.
					<br>
					<br>
					Hema’s grandfather patronized these artists and invited them to the Yaddanapudi village, to perform
					in local Ramalingeswara Temple, for Dasara and Sri Ramanavami festivals. Hema was captivated by
					hearing these fascinating stories early in her life; these stories influenced her to develop a deep
					passion for this art at a very young age.

				<p>As a child, Hema had the opportunity to meet with legendary gurus such as Vedantam Satyanarayana
					Sarma garu and Korada Narasimha Rao garu, and many others, when they visited her father at her
					childhood home to spend time with him. Her acquaintance with great Kuchipudi gurus helped Hema to
					understand the history and the progression of Kuchipudi from ages to till date.
					<br>
					<br>
					Hema's mother, Lakshmi, is also an ardent lover of music, dance, and Telegu literature. She
					encouraged Hema to learn the veena, from Sri Nallamchakravathula Krishnamachari garu, a famous
					violinist in Vijayawada Her mother’s knowledge in Telugu literature, guided her in understanding the
					meaning of literature and lyrics in Kuchipudi songs and nourished Hema to understand the Bhavam
					(emotion) and Abhinayam (expression) in the lyrics, which helped her to connect with the divinity in
					Kuchipudi in greater depth.
