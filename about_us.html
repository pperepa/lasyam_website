				<p>Hema started her first dance lessons at the young age of six. Her first Guru, Sri Bhagavthula Yagna
					Narayana Sarmagaru, was raised in the village of Kuchipudi. Her father, Y.V. Hanumatharao, is a
					renowned lawyer in Vijayawada who grew up in the village of Yaddanapudi, that neighbors
					Kuchipudi.<br><br>
					Throughout her childhood, Hema would often hear stories about the Kuchipudi art from her father. He
					would explain in great detail about the Bhagavatha Mela Natakams that he witnessed during his
					childhood when various festivals such as Sankranthi, Srirama Navami, and Dasara would occur. Hearing
					these fascinating stories early in her life is what led Hema to pursue Kuchipudi soon afterwards.

				<p>As a child, Hema had the opportunity to meet legendary gurus such as Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma
					Garu and Korada Narasimha Rao, since they would often visit her home and spend time with her
					father.<br><br>
					Hema's mother, Lakshmi, is also an ardent lover of music and dance and consistently encouraged her
					to learn Veena, the Indian stringed instrument. She is also well-versed in Telugu literature, which
					helped Hema understand the value and divinity in the Kuchipudi art form in great depth.</p>

				<p>As Hema grew older, she learned the fundamentals of Kuchipudi from the aforementioned Guru Sri
					Bhagavthula Yagna Narayana Sarmagaru and his son, Venkata Rama Sarmagaru. When it was time to move
					on to higher education, Hema continued her study of classical dance by earning diplomas in Kuchipudi
					and Bharathanatyam from {University Name Here}. She also attended Central University of Hyderabad
					for the Master's of Performing Arts program for Kuchipudi.

				<p> In addition to these degrees in the classical arts, Hema also graduated from Nagarjuna University
					with a Bachelor's of Law degree. She was also selected to serve as a judge in India in 1998, but
					turned down the position and instead immigrated to America to start a new life in the Chicagoland
					area.<br><br>A few years after settling in Illinois, Hema quickly discovered interest and
					opportunity to share her
					deep knowledge of Kuchipudi and Indian classical arts with the growing South Asian community in the
					area. She founded Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance in 2000 and has since trained many students and
					choreographed numerous Kuchipudi dance ballets, recitals, dramas and Rangapravesams (solo graduation
					dance performances).</p>

			<h2>Sharing Kuchipudi Across Generations</h2>
			<article id="a-guru-sharing-1" class="a-guru">
				<p>Over the past 21 years, Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance has established itself as a leader in
					classical Indian dance instruction and has provided its students with countless accomplishments. A
					few examples include performances at TANA and ATA Telugu assocations' national conferences, original
					dance ballets such as Seetharama Kalyanam, **\_**, and solo rangapravesams in India and America.
