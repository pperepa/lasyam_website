### Our Mission

The Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance was founded in 2000 by Hemamalini Yaddanapudi. The school has since been providing the Greater Chicagoland Area with the highest-quality instruction in the legendary art of Kuchipudi, a 14th Century South Indian classical art form.

Lasyam's mission is to empower students of all ages to begin learning about the rich cultural history of Indian dance through Kuchipudi. Students are masterfully trained in the techniques of Kuchipudi's fundamentals and provided with a deep understanding of Indian classical rhythm and literature. Our school also provides students with an everlasting resilience, robust confidence, self-reliance, and a deep appreciation for arts and culture. As part of the Lasyam family, our students undoubtedly gain a strong foundation of discipline, motivation, and versatility.

### Founding & Philosophy

In Sanskrit, the term "lasyam" means "graceful dance" performed by the Goddess Parvathi. As described by the renowned philosopher Abhinavagupta, it said as “Dasa Lasyangas”, known as Geyapadam, Stithapaatyam, Aseenam, Pushpagandika, Prachedakam, Thrimudakam, Seiydhavakam, Dwimudakam, Uttamottamakam, Ukthaprathyuktakam.

Our philosophy is to:

- Introduce South Indian culture, art, tradition, and classical wisdom to the next generation of Kuchipudi's stewards.
- Provide students with a strong foundation of Kuchipudi fundamentals, as outlined in the ancient treatise, The Natya Sastram.
- Develop students’ skills until they master the of concepts, theory, history, and choreography of Kuchipudi.
- Conduct high-quality Kuchipudi workshops, recitals, and performances featuring original ballets with renowned gurus from South India.
- Promote admiration and knowledge of the classical, ancient art of Kuchipudi so that it will be cherished and continue to be passed down  to the coming generations of artists.

## ABOUT US

### Early Roots
LASYAM’S GURU: Hemamalini Yaddanapudi, Artistic Director of “Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance.”

Hemamalini Yaddanapudi is a Kuchipudi dancer, teacher, director and choreographer
of international repute. By profession, Hema is a trained lawyer and was elected as a
Judge in Andhra Pradesh, India.

Hema started her first dance lessons when she was six years old. Her first Guru, Sri Bhagavthula Yagna Narayana Sarmagaru, hailed from the village of Kuchipudi itself. Sri Bhagavthula Yagna Narayana Sarmagaru used to come to her house to teach dance.  At first, Hema was afraid of the guru as he towered over her; she hid under her father’s office table.  Undeterred, Guru Sarma garu patiently coaxed Hema out from under the table.  This liturgy continued until she learned her first item “Rara Venu Gopa Bala.”

Hema studied under Peddamastaru’s  tutelage and earned her diplomas in Kuchipudi and Bharthanatyam; which she accomplished by the time she was in 10th grade. Hema also attended Central University of Hyderabad for the Masters of Performing Arts program for Kuchipudi. Hema also had the privilege of learning from Sarma garu’s son Venkata Rama Sarma garu and continued learning from him Vempati China Satyam garu’s style. 

Throughout her childhood, Hema heard stories about Kuchipudi her father Y.V. Hanumatharao,  a renowned lawyer in Vijayawada, who hailed from Yaddanapudi (a town neighbors Kuchipudi).  Growing up near Kuchipudi, he witnessed various festivals in temples for occasions such as Sankranthi, Srirama Navami, and Dasara celebrations. As a child, Hema heard her father share the wonderful memories about Bhagavatha Mela Natakams, and was capitvated. Hearing these fascinating stories early in her life helped Hema develop deep passion for this art at a very young age. 

As a child, Hema had the opportunity to meet with legendary gurus such as Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma Garu and Korada Narasimha Rao garu, and many famous when they visited her childhood home to spend time with her father. Her acquaintance with great Kuchipudi gurus, visiting her house regularly in her childhood helped Hema to understand the history and the progress of Kuchipudi from ages to till date.

Hema's mother, Lakshmi, is also an ardent lover of music, dance, and Telegu literature. She encouraged Hema to learn the veena instrument from Sri Nallamchakravathula Krishnamachari garu, a famous violinist in Vijayawada. Her mother’s knowledge in Telugu literature, guided her in understanding the meaning of literature and lyrics in Kuchipudi and nourished Hema to connect to the Bhavam(emotion) and Abhinayam (expression) to the lyrics, and the divinity in the Kuchipudi art form in great depth.

### Profession & Passion

Hema founded the Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance in 2000 and has since trained many students and choreographed numerous Kuchipudi dance ballets, recitals, dramas and Rangapravesams (solo graduation dance performances).

Lasyam collaborated with legendry guru Pasumarthy Ramalinga Satry garu to bring the famed Kuchipudi ballet, Bhamakalapam, to Chicago. Her students were given the opportunity to learn from a living Kuchipudi legend. In addition to working with a legendary guru, Lasyam students also experienced performing with an internationally acclaimed live orchestra for their Rangaprevesams. 

Over the past 21 years, Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance has established itself as a leader in classical Indian dance instruction and has provided its students with countless accomplishments. A few examples include performances at TANA and ATA Telugu assocations' national conferences, and Kuchipudi productions of original dance ballets such as Seetharama Kalyanam, Bhamakalapam, Rasavilasam, and solo Rangapravesams in India and America. Additionally, Lasyam students traveled to Cupertino, California to make history: they performed with the largest international classical dance collaboration, spanning five generations. This accomplishment made the Guinness Book of World Records in 2008. 

In addition to earning her certifications in Kuchipudi art, Hema graduated from Nagarjuna University with B.A.LLB. She was also selected to serve as a Judge in Andhra Pradesh, India in 1998. Hema earned a Masters of Law degree from Texas Tech University in 2016 . Currently, Hema works at a non-profit legal aid organization, which provides representation to residents of DuPage County.

## KUCHIPUDI

### About Kuchipudi

Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district in what is currently Andhra Pradesh, India. This village originally derived its name from Kuchelapuram. In this village, resident Brahmins practiced this traditional dance form for decades until the village itself earned its name, Kuchipudi.  The great talent within the village of Kuchipudi is nurtured by scholars and artists who continue to build its repertoire and refine its technique for centuries.

The Saint Siddhendra Yogi in the 14th century of Indian history., written the renowned Kuchipudi dance drama “ Bhamakalapam.”  It  was believed that he was blessed by Lord Nataraja (Lord of Dance) to empower people with this art. Siddhendra Yogi trained actors who put on plays by teaching them the art, to become Bhagavatulu, performers of the Bhagavata Mela Natakams. Siddhendra Yogi is said to be the first scholar to give it the current form of dance drama. Bhamakalapam is one of his celebrated compositions. He reserved the art to males only. However, in modern times, it has been embraced and celebrated by women.

#### Bhamakalapam

Bhamakalapam illustrates a famous episode from the Bhagavatam in which the proud Satyabhama insists that Lord Krishna bring her the celestial parijata plant from Lord Indra’s garden. The earliest and the most celebrated work which has been synonymous with Kuchipudi is Bhamakalapam. It may even be said that the entire infrastructure was developed on the basis of this composition by Siddendra Yogi.

Until a few decades ago, Bhamakalapam was performed for three consecutive nights and Satyabhama would remain behind a curtain held by stage attendants throughout the opening night’s performance. In the play Satyabhama is Swatdhina-pathika, Kalahantarita and Vasakasajjika, Abhisarika alternatively. The eternal oneness of Atma and Paramatma is the essence of Bhamakalapam.

She throws over the curtain her ornamented plait of hair called “Jada” studded with 27 stars symbolizing the constellation, the five hooded mythical serpent and tiny golden images of the ten incarnations  of Lord Vishnu. The Suthradhara recites devotional slokas and offers harati to the Jada. This is called Jada Bharatham.

In 1675 A.D. Abul hasan kutubshah Navab of Golkonda had given Kuchipudi Agraharam to Bhagavatulu. After Vijayanagara Dynasty Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu migrated to Melattur in Tanjavur and started teaching Kuchipudi Bhagavatham. These artists' main objective was Bhagavataradhana (Bhakthi), so they are called Bhagavatulu.

The technique of Kuchipudi makes use of fast rhythmic footwork and sculpturesque body movements. Stylized mime using hand gestures and subtle facial expression are combined, occasionally including dialogues spoken by the dancers. It is an inclusive  of Satvika, Vachika, Aharya abhinayam, and a combination of Nritya, Nrutta, Natyam.

In this blend of performance techniques, Kuchipudi is unique among the Indian classical dance styles. Today, Kuchipudi is performed either as a solo or a group presentation. Historyically,  it was performed as a dance drama, with several dancers taking different roles. The themes are mostly derived from scriptures and mythology, and the portrayal of
certain characters is a central motif of this dance form.

Kuchipudi is accompanied by Carnatic music. A typical orchestra for a Kuchipudi recital includes the mridangam, flute and violin and Ghatam. A vocalist sings the lyrics, and the Nattuvanar conducts the orchestra and recites the rhythmic Jathi patterns.
