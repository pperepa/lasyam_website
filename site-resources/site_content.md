### Founding & Philosophy

LASYAM’S GURU: Hemamalini Yaddanapudi, is the founder and Artistic Director of the Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance.

Hemamalini Yaddanapudi is a Kuchipudi dancer, teacher, director and choreographer of international repute. By profession, Hema is a trained lawyer and was selected as a Judge in Andhra Pradesh, India.

In Sanskrit, the term lasyam means "graceful, delicate dance" performed by the Goddess Parvathi. As described by the renowned Sage Nadikeswara in the book “Abhinayadarpanam”, lasyam has several “Dasa Lasyangas”, known as Geyapadam, Stithapaatyam, Aseenam, Pushpagandika, Prachedakam, Thrimudakam, Seiydhavakam, Dwimudakam, Uttamottamakam, Ukthaprathyuktakam. The word Dasa means Ten. The delicacy in Indian classical dance is known for its ten varieties of delicate graces (the subtle expressions). Hemamaili Yaddanapudi was inspired with the grace and delicacy of Kuchipudi and named her school Lasyam.

Lasyam’s philosophy is to:

- Introduce South Indian art, culture, tradition, and classical wisdom to the next generation of Kuchipudi's stewards.
- Provide students with a strong foundation of Kuchipudi fundamentals, and train them as outlined in the ancient treatise, the Natya Sastram, written by Sage Bharata.
- Develop students’ skills until they master the concepts through theory, practical skills, history, and choreography of Kuchipudi.
- Conduct high-quality solo recitals, group ballet performances, and Kuchipudi workshops with renowned gurus from South India.
- Promote knowledge and admiration for the antient classical art of Kuchipudi so that it will be cherished and continue to be passed down to coming generations of artists.

## ABOUT US

Artistic Director: Hemamalini Yaddanapudi, is the founder of the Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance.

Hema started her first dance lessons when she was six years old. Her first Guru, Sri Bhagavthula Yagna Narayana Sarmagaru, hailed from the village of Kuchipudi itself. She learned her first item from him, called “Rara Venu Gopa Bala” at age 7. Hema studied under Sarmagaru’s tutelage and earned her diplomas in Kuchipudi and Bharthanatyam; which she accomplished by the time she was 15 years old. Hema also attended the Central University of Hyderabad for the Masters of Performing Arts program for Kuchipudi. Hema also had the privilege of learning from Sarma garu’s son Bhagavathula Venkata Rama Sarma garu; under his tutelage she learned popular Kuchipudi style established by Sri Vempati China Satyam garu.

### Early Roots

Hema, throughout her childhood, heard stories about Kuchipudi from her father Y.V. Hanumatharao, a renowned lawyer in Vijayawada, who hailed from Yaddanapudi (a town neighboring  Kuchipudi). Growing up near Kuchipudi, he experienced Kuchipudi performances in temples during various festivals. As a child, Hema heard her father share the wonderful memories about Kuchipudi dancers and their performances, called the Veedhi Natakam or Veedhi Bhagavatam, known as “Bhagavatha Mela Natakams” (Stories of God), which are traditionally performed by the traveling dance troupe which consisted entirely of men (often Brahmins). These traveling dance troupes moved from village to village and performed near local Hindu temples.

Hema’s grandfather patronized these artists and invited them to the Yaddanapudi village, to perform in local Ramalingeswara Temple, for Dasara and Sri Ramanavami festivals. Hema was captivated by hearing these fascinating stories early in her life; these stories influenced her to develop a deep passion for this art at a very young age.

As a child, Hema had the opportunity to meet with legendary gurus such as Vedantam Satyanarayana Sarma garu and Korada Narasimha Rao garu, and many others, when they visited her father at her childhood home to spend time with him. Her acquaintance with great Kuchipudi gurus helped Hema to understand the history and the progression of Kuchipudi from ages to till date.

Hema's mother, Lakshmi, is also an ardent lover of music, dance, and Telegu literature. She encouraged Hema to learn the veena, from Sri Nallamchakravathula Krishnamachari garu, a famous violinist in Vijayawada Her mother’s knowledge in Telugu literature, guided her in understanding the meaning of literature and lyrics in Kuchipudi songs and nourished Hema to understand the Bhavam (emotion) and Abhinayam (expression) in the lyrics, which helped her to connect with the divinity in Kuchipudi in greater depth.

### Passion & Profession

Hema founded the Lasyam School of Kuchipudi Dance in 2000 and has since trained many students and choreographed numerous Kuchipudi dance recitals, dramas, and Rangapravesams (solo graduation dance performances).

Lasyam collaborated with legendry guru Pasumarthy Ramalinga Satry garu to bring the famed Kuchipudi ballet, “Bhamakalapam,” to Chicago. Her students were given the rare opportunity to learn from a living Kuchipudi legend. In addition to working with a legendary guru, Lasyam students have performed with an internationally acclaimed live orchestra for their Rangaprevesams.

In addition to earning her certifications in Kuchipudi, Hema graduated from Nagarjuna University with B.A.B.L. She was also selected to serve as a Judge in Andhra Pradesh, India in 1998. Hema earned a Masters of Law degree from Texas Tech University in 2016. Currently, Hema works at a non-profit legal aid organization, which provides representation to residents of DuPage County.

## KUCHIPUDI

### About Kuchipudi

Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district, which is currently in State of Andhra Pradesh, India. This village originally derived its name from Kuchelapuram. In this village, resident Brahmins practiced this traditional dance form for decades until the village itself earned the name Kuchipudi.  The great talent within the village of Kuchipudi is nurtured by scholars, gurus, and artists who refined its technique for centuries and continue to build its repertoire.

It was believed that the Saint Siddhendra Yogi, in the 14th century of Indian history, was blessed by Lord Nataraja (Lord of Dance) and taught the first dance drama to Kuchipudi Brahmin boys, to empower them. He was the author of the renowned Kuchipudi dance drama “Bhamakalapam.”  Siddhendra Yogi trained actors who put on plays by teaching them, to become Bhagavatulu, performers of the Bhagavata Mela Natakams. Siddhendra Yogi is said to be the first scholar to give it the current form of dance drama. Bhamakalapam is one of his celebrated compositions. He reserved Kuchipudi to males only. However, in modern times, it has been embraced and celebrated by women.

Later in 1675 A.D. Abul Hasan Kutubshah Navab of Golkonda had given Kuchipudi Agraharam to Bhagavatulu. After the Vijayanagara Dynasty, some of these Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu migrated to other villages, like Melattur in Tanjavur, and started teaching Kuchipudi Bhagavatham. These artists' main objective was Bhagavataradhana (Bhakthi), so they are called Bhagavatulu.
The repertoire of Kuchipudi, follows the three categories of performance inferred from the ancient treatise on Dramaturgy, the Natya Sastra. These are Nritta (pure dance, fast and rhythmic foot work), Nritya (expressive dance to communicate feelings and emotions) and Natya (play production). 
Kuchipudi is accompanied by Carnatic music. A typical orchestra for a Kuchipudi recital includes the mridangam, flute, veena, violin, and ghatam. A vocalist sings the songs, and the Nattuvanar conducts the orchestra and recites the rhythmic Jathi patterns.

Kuchipudi is unique among the Indian classical dance styles for its dance dramas with live dialogues while performing on the stage and male  actors who also take female roles. The earliest and the most celebrated work in Kuchipudi is, the famous dance drama Bhamakalapam, another is Tarangam.

 Tarangam, the performer dances on the edges of a brass plate, executing complicated rhythmic foot patterns with dexterity, while also balancing a brass pot of water on their head. The Tarangam demonstrates a dancer’s masterful coordination and understanding of balance, rhythm, and speed, while employing incomparable abhinayam.

#### Bhamakalapam

Bhamakalapam illustrates a famous episode from the Bhagavatam in which the proud Princess Satyabhama insists that Lord Krishna, her husband, bring her the celestial Parijata plant from Lord Indra’s garden.

It starts with the Suthradhara, who recites devotional slokas and offers harati to the Princess Satyabhama’s Jada (long plaited hair). This is called the Jada Bharatham. In this act, Princess Satyabhama  throws over her curtain of hair ornamented with 27 studded stars which symbolize the constellation, a five hooded mythical serpent, and tiny golden images of the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Bhamakalapam was initially performed for three days with the Jada Bharatam act, but more recently, a shorter version called Pravesa Dharuvu is performed. The essence of Bhamakalapam is, the eternal oneness of Atma, (Satyabhama) and Paramatma (Krishna).
