### About Kuchipudi

Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district that borders the Bay of Bengal , derived its
name from Kuchelapuram, with resident Brahmins practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name,
where it was nurtured by great scholars and artists who built up the repertoire and refined the dance technique.

It was under Siddhendra Yogi blessed by Lord Nataraja ( Lord of Dance) in 14th century that the actual training of the
actors was developed to make them into Bhagavatulu, performers of the Bhagavata Mela Natakams.

In 1675 A.D. Abul hasan kutubshah Navab of Golkonda had given Kuchipudi Agraharam to Bhagavatulu. After
Vijayanagara Dynasty Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu migrated to Melattur in Tanjavur and started teaching Kuchipudi
Bhagavatham. These artists' main objective was Bhagavataradhana (Bhakthi), so they are called Bhagavatulu.

The technique of Kuchipudi makes use of fast rhythmic footwork and sculpturesque body movements. Stylized mime
using hand gestures and subtle facial expression are combined, occasionally including dialogues spoken by the dancers.
In this blend of performance techniques, Kuchipudi is unique among the Indian classical dance styles. Today Kuchipudi
is performed either as a solo or a group presentation, but historically it was performed as a dance drama, with several
dancers taking different roles. The themes are mostly derived form the scriptures and mythology, and the portrayal of
certain characters is a central motif of this dance form.

One example is Satyabhama, the colourful second consort of Lord Krishna. Another unique feature of Kuchipudi is the
Tarangam, in which the performer dances on the edges of a brass plate, executing complicated rhythmic patterns with
dexterity, while sometimes also balancing a pot of water on the head.

Kuchipudi is accompanied by Carnatic music. A typical orchestra for a Kuchipudi recital includes the mridangam, flute and violin. A vocalist sings the lyrics, and the nattuvanar conducts the orchestra and recites the rhythmic patterns.

### Siddhendra Yogi

Siddhendra Yogi is said to be the first scholar to give it the current form of dance drama. Bhamakalapam is one of his
celebrated compositions. He also reserved the art to males by teaching it to young brahmin boys of the village.
However, in modern times, the art has been embraced by women.

### Bhamakalapam

The earliest and the most celebrated work which has been synonymous with the style is Bhamakalapam. It may even be
said that the entire infrastructure was developed on the basis of this composition by Siddendra Yogi.
Bhamakalapam deals with the famous episode from the Bhagavatam in which proud Satyabhama insists that Krishna bring
her the celestial parijata plant from Lord Indra’s garden. The play which opens with lively Pravesa Daruvu employs the
Samvada and the Abhinaya daruvus numbering about 90.

Till three- four decades ago, Bhamakalapam was performed on three consecutive nights and Satyabhama would remain
behind the curtain held by stage attendants throughout the opening night’s performance. She throws over the curtain her
ornamented plait of hair called “Jada” studded with 27 stars symbolizing the constellation, the five hooded mythical
serpent and tiny golden images of the ten avatars of Lord Vishnu. The suthradhara recites devotional slokas and offers
arati to the Jada. This is called Jada Bharatham.

In the play Satyabhama is Swatdhina-pathika, Kalahantarita and vasakasajjika, alternatively. The eternal oneness of Atma
and Paramatma is the essence of Bhamakalapam.
